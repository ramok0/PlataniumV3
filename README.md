## FAQ

#### Can i get banned using this ?

You can't as there is no anti-cheat running alongside fortnite 

#### My antivirus is detecting PlataniumV3 as a virus, is it safe ?

- PlataniumV3 is safe, and its launcher is also safe. However, it may be flagged as a virus because it injects DLL files into Fortnite

- If you don't trust me, you can review the source code and build it yourself.
